# RSCG - Examples of Roslyn Source Code Generators 

If you want to see them , please goto  ***[V2](https://ignatandrei.github.io/RSCG_Examples/v2/docs/List-of-RSCG)***
## Introduction

I have started this project/book in  2021 because I was impressed of Roslyn Source Code Generators(RSCG). In meantime Microsoft started to improve how we wrote RSCG ( see Incremental Generators) and C# / NET ( see namespaces and records).For this, a lot of examples of v1 are now invalid / not maintained

 Also, Microsoft is using more and more RSCG in their code base ( e.g. JSON Generators for System.Text.Json) and I think that RSCG will be a big part of C# / NET future. For this , I will revisit the examples of v1 and I will add new ones.

 For historical reasons, I will keep the old examples in a separate folder - see  https://github.com/ignatandrei/RSCG_Examples/tree/main/v1  folder.
