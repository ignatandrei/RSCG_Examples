Hello Martin Andreas Ulrich

I have started a mini-e-book about Roslyn Source Code Generators(RSCG).

Your RSCG , data-builder-generator from https://github.com/dasMulli/data-builder-generator , is between them at https://github.com/ignatandrei/RSCG_Examples/tree/main/DP_Builder

I am thinking to add to the e-book the some more information regarding the RSCG from the authors of RSCG.

So could you please answer to the following :

1. Short info about you , Martin Andreas Ulrich

2. Why did you start this data-builder-generator  ?

3. How do yourself use your data-builder-generator ?

4. What other RSCG do you use ? 

5. Any other feedback ?

Thanks

Andrei Ignat
