## Author of BoilerplateFree ,  Gustav Wengel

### Short info about you ,  Gustav Wengel

I'm a 28 year old software developer from Aarhus, Denmark. I work primarily within CleanTech as I think the climate emergency is one of the most pressing issues we face currently. I've worked with C# and .NET for about two years.

###  Why did you start this BoilerplateFree  ?
Because I thought some of the limitations that the C# language offers sucked. I saw things like Project Lombok in the Java space that made the language much more ergonomic, and I wanted to see if I could bring some of that stuff into the C# space.


###  How do yourself use your BoilerplateFree  ?

I use it for a few small-scale production projects. I think the jury is still out whether or not using source generators this way is a good idea or not, but so far it's been a real positive experience.

###  What other RSCG do you use ?

None yet.


###  Any other feedback ?

Nope!
