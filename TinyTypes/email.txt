Hello Andreas Dorfer

I have started a mini-e-book about Roslyn Source Code Generators(RSCG).

Your RSCG , BaseTypes from https://github.com/Andreas-Dorfer/base-types , is between them at https://github.com/ignatandrei/RSCG_Examples/tree/main/TinyTypes

I am thinking to add to the e-book the some more information regarding the RSCG from the authors of RSCG.

So could you please answer to the following :

1. Short info about you , Andreas Dorfer

2. Why did you start this BaseTypes  ?

3. How do yourself use your BaseTypes ?

4. What other RSCG do you use ? 

5. Any other feedback ?

Thanks

Andrei Ignat
