## Content 

I am trying here to add good practices , as I see 

 ## Add a version

[global::System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCode("Name", "1.0.0.0")]

Could use AssmeblyInfo 

## General attributes / code 

Problem - make internal or have another assembly referenced ( or the opposite)

## mark the code as non - code coverage

[global::System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]



 ## Add comments for method / classes  /  properties generated

 could have warnings as errors .


 ## Add nullable enable
