This package generates a static `ThisAssembly.Strings` class with public 
constants exposing string resources in .resx files or methods with the right number of 
parameters for strings that use formatting parameters. 

In addition, it groups constants and methods in nested classes according to an optional 
underscore separator to organize strings. For example, *User_InvalidCredentials* can be
accessed with *ThisAssembly.Strings.User.InvalidCredentials* if it contains a simple string, 
or as a method with the right number of parametres if its value has a format string.
