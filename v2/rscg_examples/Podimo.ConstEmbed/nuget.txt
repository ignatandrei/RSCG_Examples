A source generator that turns additional files into file constants in a generated namespace.
            This is an alternative approach to embedding files in C# source manually,
            or loading them manually as embedded resources via reflection.
            With ConstEmbed, you will never have to see a runtime error because you mistyped the name,
            as the constants are evaluated at compile-time.
