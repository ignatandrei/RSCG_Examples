The HttpClient factory is a pattern for configuring and retrieving named HttpClients in a composable way. The HttpClient factory provides extensibility to plug in DelegatingHandlers that address cross-cutting concerns such as service location, load balancing, and reliability. The default HttpClient factory provides built-in diagnostics and logging and manages the lifetimes of connections in a performant way.
      Commonly used types:
