This repository contains my explorations on c# source code generation and analysis.

The [UnionsGenerator](UnionsGenerator) generator enables the use of union types in C#.

The [UtilityGenerators](UtilityGenerators) generator helps you write code generators and analyzers.

The [CopyTo](CopyTo) generator generates methods to copy the contents of one instance to another. I created this generator for a friend, so it is not as feature rich as it could be.
