This package contains a Souce Generator which generates Value Objects that wrap simple primitives such as int, string, double etc.

      A ValueObject is a strongly typed (strongly, not stringly) domain object that is immutable.

      Instead of `int customerId = 42;` we have `var customerId = CustomerId.From(42);`

      To use, just create something like this:

      ```csharp
      [ValueObject(typeof(int))]
      public partial struct CustomerId
      {
      }

      var customerId = CustomerId.From(42);
      ```

      Validation is in just one place. You can't introduce bad objects into your domain, therefore you can assume that in your domain every ValueObject is valid.
