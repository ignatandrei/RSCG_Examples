# AutoDeconstruct

A library that automatically adds support for object deconstruction in C#.

## Overview

The idea started with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1462106117564207104) - specifically, [this reply](https://twitter.com/dave_peixoto/status/1462181358248374278). I thought...how automatic can I make object deconstruction in C#? That's what this source generator is all about.
