      - ObservableValidator: a base class for objects implementing the INotifyDataErrorInfo interface.
      - RelayCommand: a simple delegate command implementing the ICommand interface.
      - AsyncRelayCommand: a delegate command supporting asynchronous operations and cancellation.
      - WeakReferenceMessenger: a messaging system to exchange messages through different loosely-coupled objects.
      - StrongReferenceMessenger: a high-performance messaging system that trades weak references for speed.
      - Ioc: a helper class to configure dependency injection service containers.
