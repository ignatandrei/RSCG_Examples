Hello Atif Aziz

I have started a mini-e-book about Roslyn Source Code Generators(RSCG).

Your RSCG , Transplator from https://github.com/atifaziz/Transplator/ , is between them at https://github.com/ignatandrei/RSCG_Examples/tree/main/TemplateRender

I am thinking to add to the e-book the some more information regarding the RSCG from the authors of RSCG.

So could you please answer to the following :

1. Short info about you , Atif Aziz

2. Why did you start this Transplator  ?

3. How do yourself use your Transplator ?

4. What other RSCG do you use ? 

5. Any other feedback ?

Thanks
