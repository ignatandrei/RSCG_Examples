###  Short info about you , Robin Hermanussen

I'm a Software Architect at Iquality (software company in the Netherlands). I'm passionate about software development in general, but with a particular interest in .NET.

###  Why did you start this MockSourceGenerator ?
I have written a bunch of C# analyzers in the past that served specific needs and now wanted to get some experience in writing source generators. The thing about libraries like Moq or NSubstitute that I don't really like is how it takes so much code to set them up and then I don't find them very readable. MockSourceGenerator takes an approach that allows people to mock something in a single statement (with an object initializer) and I think it is more readable this way.

###  How do yourself use your MockSourceGenerator ?
I'm not really using it in real world projects right now, as I'm not working on any projects that require it.

###  What other RSCG do you use ?
I've used ThisAssembly and a few others, for learning purposes.

###  Any other feedback ?
If anyone wants to use MockSourceGenerator and give me feedback from the real world, let me know! I'll be happy to help out with any issues or questions you may run into. Just add an issue to the project on GitHub to get in touch.
