Hello Thomas Bleijendaal

I have started a mini-e-book about Roslyn Source Code Generators(RSCG).

Your RSCG , GeneratedMapper from https://github.com/ThomasBleijendaal/GeneratedMapper , is between them at https://github.com/ignatandrei/RSCG_Examples/tree/main/DTOMapper

I am thinking to add to the e-book the some more information regarding the RSCG from the authors of RSCG.

So could you please answer to the following :

1. Short info about you , Thomas Bleijendaal

2. Why did you start this GeneratedMapper  ?

3. How do yourself use your GeneratedMapper ?

4. What other RSCG do you use ? 

5. Any other feedback ?

Thanks
