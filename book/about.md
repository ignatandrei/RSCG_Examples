# About this book

## Content of the book

You will find in this book code examples about >10 Roslyn Source Code Generator (RSCG ) that can be usefull for you. That means, you will write more elegant and concise code - even if the generators code is not always nice to look.

## Are those examples ready for production ?

I have done due diligence to test the RSCG that I have show to you here. However, I cannot guarantee that will fit your code . That means that you can test it for your case and, because all are open source on Github.com , you can contribute to improve them ;-)

## I have a suggestion for a new RGSC that is worth mentioning in this book . What can I do ?
