# About this book

## Content of the book

You will find in this book code examples about >10 Roslyn Source Code Generator (RSCG ) that can be usefull for you. That means, you will write more elegant and concise code - even if the generators code is not always nice to look.

## Are those examples ready for production ?

I have done due diligence to test the RSCG that I have show to you here. However, I cannot guarantee that will fit your code . That means that you can test it for your case and, because all are open source on Github.com , you can contribute to improve them ;-)


## How to read this book

For each chapter, you will find 

1.  Name of the RSCG and link to the NuGet package / GitHub repository
2.  What the RSCG can do
3.  What will be the initial code
4.  How to use the Code generated by RSCG
5.  Code Generated by RSCG
6.  Link to the downloadable code to practice
