### Short info about you , Stanislav Silin

I am a software developer. Interested in the app architecture and performance optimizations

### Why did you start this ApparatusAOT ?

I am constantly looking for ways how to reduce the amount of boilerplate code. So, I decided to make a place where I can put all my findings. Maybe they will be useful for someone else.
 'Apparatus' is the name of a community/organization. The 'AOT' is just a suffix for the indication that the tool is intended for the AOT scenarios.

### How do yourself use your ApparatusAOT ?

Right now, ZeroIoc is actively used in one commercial project. Other stuff like AOT.Reflection, DuckInterface in just experiments to investigate the possibility and effectiveness of such tools.

### What other RSCG do you use ?

At the moment I don't use any of them.
